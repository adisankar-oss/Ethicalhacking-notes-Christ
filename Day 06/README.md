Cybersecurity Notes – DAY 06
1. Middleware

A software layer positioned between the operating system and applications.
Provides common services such as communication, authentication, and data management.
Examples include database middleware, message queues, and API gateways.


2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

A cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and may alter communication between two parties.
Both victims believe they are communicating directly with each other.
Common techniques: ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and compromised Wi-Fi networks.


3. Using Proxies to Capture Traffic

Proxies serve as intermediaries between a browser and the target server.
They are used to monitor, analyze, and manipulate web traffic.
Tools such as Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP enable capturing and modifying requests/responses.


4. OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks

A globally recognized list of the most critical web application security risks.
Current categories include:

Broken Access Control
Cryptographic Failures
Injection (SQL, Command, etc.)
Insecure Design
Security Misconfiguration
Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Identification and Authentication Failures
Software and Data Integrity Failures
Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)




5. Wireshark (on Kali Linux)

A powerful network protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting packets in real time.
Useful for troubleshooting, monitoring, and detecting malicious activity.
Commonly used in penetration testing to analyze traffic on Kali Linux.
Supports advanced filtering to focus on specific protocols, IPs, or sessions.


Flipper Zero
A portable multi-tool for security researchers and enthusiasts.
It resembles a Tamagotchi-style gadget but is designed for exploring digital systems.

Features

RFID/NFC → Read and emulate access cards (e.g., office badges, metro cards).
Radio (Sub-1 GHz) → Interact with garage doors, car keys, IoT devices.
Infrared (IR) → Functions as a universal remote (TVs, ACs, etc.).
USB Mode → Emulates USB devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.).
GPIO Pins → Interface with hardware modules and sensors.


Use Cases

Security Testing → Evaluate RFID, wireless, and hardware system security.
Experimentation → Explore IoT protocols, remote controls, and hardware hacking.
Learning Tool → Helps understand hardware, radio frequencies, and embedded systems.
